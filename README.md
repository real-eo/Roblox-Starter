# Roblox-Starter
I am super tired of the roblox player updating every single time and adding a new shortcut to my desktop along with it. The worst part is that I have to then move to my other disk so my desktop is sorted like I want it. That's why I made this program, so that it would automatically find the newest version from within my Roblox version directory, and run that one. The code is probably mega sloppy, and definitivly overengineered as fuck, but i can't care less because it's late, and i'm reallllllllllly tired of writing this code that should've taken 30 min max
